license=Actuate(R) Software License and Support Services Agreement\n\n\n\
\
NOTE: By ordering, accepting, installing, copying, uploading, downloading or using software product(s) including license keys associated with the software ("Software") and support services provided by Actuate  Corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates ("Actuate"), you \n\n\
\
*  represent that, if you are not ordering, accepting, installing, copying, uploading, downloading or using the Software in an individual capacity, you are duly authorized to represent the legal entity that orders the Software or for whose benefit you are ordering, accepting, installing, copying, uploading, downloading or using the Software and support services (as an individual or in such representative capacity, the "Corporate End-User"); \n\n\
\
*  represent that the Corporate End-User is the legal entity identified in the applicable quotations, purchase orders, invoices and/or other documentation related to the acquisition of the Software and support services; \n\n\
\
*  agree that you, on behalf of the Corporate End-User, will refrain from violating the terms of this Software License and Support Services Agreement ("SLA"), and will ensure that individual users employed or under contract with the Corporate End-User at all times comply with the terms and conditions herein; and \n\n\
\
*  represent that you are properly authorized to conclude a legally binding agreement based on the terms of this SLA between Actuate and the Corporate End-User. \n\n\
\
If you do not agree with any of the terms of this SLA, Actuate does not grant any licenses to the Software and support services. In such event, you may not install, copy, upload, download or otherwise make any use of the Software support services, and you must return to Actuate the complete Software package, including the disks and printed materials immediately; or, if you downloaded the Software, notify Actuate in writing that you have de-installed the Software, within ten (10) days of your initial receipt of the Software. Upon receipt of such notification, Actuate, or a reseller or distributor with Actuate's authority, will issue a refund of any applicable license and support fees pre-paid by you, if any. If you do not comply with these return and notification requirements, you or the Corporate End-User will not be entitled to a refund. Use of the Software in the absence of a license authorized by Actuate constitutes an infringement of Actuate's intellectual property rights. \n\n\
\
In the remainder of this SLA, you and/or the Corporate End-User are referred to as "You" and its derivative "Your(s)". \n\n\n\
\
1. END-USER LICENSE.\n\n\
\
1.1  Software License Grant. Unless Actuate, or a distributor with Actuate's authority, has expressly notified You in writing (e.g., in an order acknowledgement, through an Actuate web site order, invoice, or license key documentation) that one or more of the Licensing Methods and Deployment Types defined in Schedule 1 to this SLA apply to Software acquired by You, upon Your acceptance of all terms and conditions of this SLA and payment of the proper fees, Actuate hereby grants You a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable and non-transferable license to install one (1) copy of object code of the Software on one (1) computer, and to upload and execute and use that copy so installed as an Evaluation License only. The Software is licensed, and not sold, to You. You may not use any Software not listed in an ordering document, even if such unlicensed software is made available to You as part of Actuate's general delivery mechanism. \n\n\
\
1.2  Software License Parameters in Schedule 1. The scope of Actuate's license grant to You is further defined and limited by the license parameters described in Schedule 1. The Licensing Method (e.g., Named User, Named Developer, CPU Based, etc.) for a given project or application must be consistent across Your Test and Production environments for such project or application. (e.g., If You use Named User-based Software licenses for Your payroll application in Production use, then any Test Software for such payroll application must be licensed on a Named User-basis also). The license parameters described in Schedule 1 may be applied in combination by Actuate (e.g., Named User and Test Software). \n\n\
\
If You have any doubts about the applicability of the license parameters to the Software licensed by You, You must contact Actuate immediately. You agree that the burden of proof is on You: if You use the Software beyond the scope of the applicable license grant, You are committing a material breach of this SLA and a violation of Actuate's intellectual property rights. You should not rely on oral, written or email statements by Actuate services or sales professionals regarding Your entitlement to Software or any other rights under the SLA.\n\n\
\
1.3  No Cost and Evaluation Licenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Software is being provided on a No Cost basis, or for Evaluation purposes, then You agree: (a) to use the Software solely for such purposes; (b) that the Evaluation Software will not be used or deployed in any other type of Deployment environment; and (c) use of Evaluation Software shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of forty-five (45) days from the date You receive the right to install the Software or Your receipt of notice of termination from Actuate ; and (d) use of No Cost Software shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of one (1) year from the date You receive the right to install the Software or Your receipt of notice of termination from Actuate.\n\n\
\
1.4  Licenses to Updates and Information. Updates to the Software are governed by the version of the license agreement delivered with that version of the Software.\n\n\
\
1.5  CPU Notice and Upgrade Requirements. Prior to installation of the Software, You shall notify Actuate in writing in accordance with Section 7.15 of this SLA of the location, brand, host name, model name and number of the Server, and the number, type and speed of each of the CPUs, including thread count per CPU, of each Server on which any component of the Software is to be installed or the Software can Access, and any other information reasonably requested by Actuate ("Identifying Information").\n\n\
\
Once installed, You must obtain Actuate's written consent before You discontinue the use of any Software from any Server (or CPUs within the Server) and begin use of the same Software on another Server (or CPUs within the Server) whether as part of a hardware and/or simultaneous hardware/software upgrade, or any other reason, which movement or transfer may be subject to a Server or CPU upgrade transfer license fee and related Maintenance Services fee at Actuate's discretion. Your request for Actuate's consent shall be submitted in writing in accordance with Section 7.15 of this SLA and must include the Identifying Information of the Server or CPU from and to which the Software is being moved. Actuate may withhold Software license key(s) if Actuate cannot verify that You are using the Software in an authorized manner. If Actuate grants its consent in a signed writing, You may reinstall the Software on the new Server or CPU on the condition that You delete the Software from the previous Server or CPU within five (5) days of successful reinstallation. The restrictions set forth in this Section apply to each time You desire to move the Software to a new Server.\n\n\
\
Software may be "Node Locked." Node Locked Software uses a unique license key to activate Software on a specific instance of hardware (i.e., the node identification information for the hardware is embedded in particular license key by Actuate). That license key is then verified against the hardware's node identification information before the Software's functionality can be enabled. To enable Node Locked Software, You must provide Actuate with the node identification information of Your hardware by running a utility that accompanies the Node Locked Software and following the instructions. Actuate will then send You a node lock key for that hardware and Software combination. The initial keys delivered with the Software will time out after 30 days. Node locked license keys will follow after necessary hardware, deployment type and other information is provided for each licensed Instance. \n\n\
\
You agree to use each license key issued only for one (1) copy of the Software and on one (1) identified, properly licensed Server or cluster of Servers. For every new license key ("New Key") that is issued to replace an existing license key (the "Old Key"), You will (i) immediately and permanently destroy and stop all use of the Old Key, (ii) use the New Key only with Software that has been properly licensed and paid for by You, (iii) not transfer or assign the New Keys, (iv) without the prior consent of Actuate and the payment of an appropriate assignment or transfer fee, the New Key(s) cannot be installed on hardware other than the hardware where the Actuate software was originally installed, (v) each New Key may only be used for one Instance of the Actuate software on one (1) identified piece of hardware, or one (1) environment in the case of a properly licensed clustered environment. You represent and warrant that any individual requesting New Key(s) is authorized to do so on Your behalf and that the location, brand, model name and number of the server, and the number, type and speed of the CPUs of the server on which the license key(s) is to be installed or the Software can Access that You provide to Actuate, which may be done via email, is accurate.\n\n\
\
1.6  Territorial Limitation. You may not install, copy, upload, download, execute, or otherwise use the Software outside of the country to which the Software was initially shipped.\n\n\
\
1.7  Copies. After You have installed a copy of the Software in accordance with this SLA, You may keep the original copy (as downloaded from an Actuate website or delivered on a physical medium) for Archival Use purposes only. If any mandatory, non-waivable laws of any jurisdictions permit You to create one or more back-up emergency restart copies, You may exercise such rights but, except for such mandatory, non-waivable rights, You agree not to create any additional copies of the Software or accompanying documentation ("Documentation"). You acknowledge and agree that, among other methods of copying, Software is copied when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other physical storage device) that can be accessed by the relevant computer. You further acknowledge and agree that any Hot/Warm Back-Up use is not permitted without payment of the appropriate license fee for such use.\n\n\
\
1.8  Open Source Software. If You use open source software or any other Third-Party Component not supplied by Actuate in conjunction with the Software, You must ensure that its use does not: (a) create, or purport to create, obligations of use with respect to the Software, or (b) grant, or purport to grant, to any third-party any rights to or immunities under Actuate's Proprietary Information. You also may not combine Software with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") or any similar license in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Software or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.\n\n\
\
1.9  Other Limitations. You shall not rent, lease, loan, sell or otherwise distribute the Software or any derivative works of the Software. You may not grant access to the Software to any third-parties, except that You may enable customers to create content based on Your internal databases in Software that You host on Your premises under Your control (e.g., if You are a financial services provider and You have obtained the necessary licenses, You may enable Your customers to run reports on the status of their accounts with You through a web browser interface, but You may not transfer possession of copies of any portion of the Software to Your customers or allow them to run reports on Your customers' own databases). You may not engage in hosted application or service bureau activities whereby You execute the Software to create content using databases that Your direct or indirect customers own or otherwise supply or make available to You. You may not use the Software in connection with ultrahazardous activities, or any facility, activity or system for which failure of the Software might result in death or serious bodily injury to You or a third-party, including without limitation, nuclear, missile, or chemical and biological weaponry end uses. You shall not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to derive or manipulate the source code of the Software, except as permitted under mandatory, non-waivable laws, and even then only after You have provided thirty (30) days prior written notice to Actuate, in accordance with Section 7.15 herein, that You intend to do so in order to give Actuate an opportunity, at Actuate's sole discretion, to provide information to You that alleviates the need for reverse engineering or other activities.\n\n\
\
1.10  Term. Unless You have been notified that a shorter term or a Subscription or Evaluation license applies, the license granted in this SLA remains effective until terminated as provided herein. \n\n\n\
\
\
2. OWNERSHIP; CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\n\
\
2.1  All Rights Reserved. Except for the limited license granted to You herein, Actuate retains title, ownership and all rights and interests in and to the Software.\n\n\
\
2.2  Proprietary Information. You agree that the Software and all computer code (in object and source form), inventions, algorithms, know-how and information embodied in or by the Software and all other business, technical and financial information You obtain from Actuate, whether designated confidential or not, constitute Actuate's confidential property ("Proprietary Information"). You also agree that any expression of Actuate's findings, analyses, conclusions, opinions, recommendations, ideas, techniques, know-how, designs, programs, enhancements, software, and other technical or business information provided to You by Actuate in the course of performing consulting, training, or support services related to the Software are the Proprietary Information of Actuate. All proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Software, Documentation or materials shall be duplicated by You on all authorized copies of the Software, Documentation or materials, as applicable, and shall not be altered, removed or obliterated.\n\n\
\
2.3 	Usage Information. The Software collects and reports product usage information to Actuate. You agree Actuate may use this information to enhance and assist user experiences and for marketing efforts. You may turn off this feature by following the instructions in the Documentation.\n\n\
\
2.4  Suggestions. Actuate shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Software and any support services any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by You or Your authorized users relating to the use of the Software or support services.\n\n\
\
2.5  Non-Disclosure. You agree to keep the Proprietary Information in a secure place, under access and use restrictions designed to prevent disclosure of the Proprietary Information to unauthorized persons, and to instruct and effectively obligate Your personnel to keep the Proprietary Information confidential and use it only as expressly permitted by this SLA. The obligations specified in this Section 2.4 shall not apply to any Proprietary Information that: (a) is now available or becomes available to the public without breach of this SLA; (b) is lawfully obtained from a third-party or parties without a duty of confidentiality; (c) is known to You or independently developed by You without the use of any of Proprietary Information or any breach of this SLA, as documented and proven by You; or (d) is required to be disclosed by a valid court order, provided that You have first given Actuate reasonable written notice of such requirement and You fully cooperate with Actuate in seeking limitations to, and confidential treatment for, any such disclosure.\n\n\
\
2.6  Breach. As any use or disclosure of Proprietary Information in breach of this SLA will cause irreparable injury to Actuate that cannot be compensated solely by monetary damages, You agree that any such use or disclosure:  (a) constitutes a material breach of this SLA; (b) will terminate all licenses granted by this SLA; and (c) will entitle Actuate to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies available under this SLA, at law, or in equity, without the need of placing a bond or proving damages. You further agree to promptly pay for any such breach at the higher of the non-discounted list price in effect (i) at the time any unlicensed use is discovered by, or made known to, Actuate or (ii) at the time You installed the Software.\n\n\n\
\
\
3. SUPPORT. \n\n\
\
The "Support Policy" applies to support services provided by Actuate for the Software and may be modified by Actuate from time to time. Support is mandatory for the first year of Your Software license and will be renewed annually unless You or Actuate elect not to renew it as further detailed in Section 6.2 herein. Neither Actuate nor any of its authorized resellers or distributors have any obligation to provide support services unless agreed otherwise in writing for a specified term and price, which shall not survive any termination of this SLA. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Actuate may, but is under no obligation to, support Evaluation Licenses or No Cost Software. The same level of support must be purchased for all Software installed on each Server or cluster of Servers or for a portion of an application even if the application is running on more than one (1) unit of hardware. Support may not be discontinued on a portion of the Software installed on a Server or cluster of Servers. All Software (a) on a particular Server or cluster of Servers or (b) used for an application must be on the highest common level of support. Support Policies for particular products are indicated at http://www.actuate.com/supportpolicy.\n\n\n\
\

\
4.2  Limited Support Services Warranty.

Upon such termination, Actuate shall refund to You on a pro-rated basis any pre-paid support services fees for the time after Actuate's receipt of Your last written request to cure. THE TERMINATION AND REFUND RIGHT SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 4.2 SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO SUPPORT SERVICES OR ANY UPDATES, INFORMATION OR OTHER ITEMS PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH SUPPORT SERVICES. Termination of support services shall not terminate this SLA.\n\n\
\

IN NO EVENT SHALL ACTUATE'S TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY YOU UNDER THIS SLA. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY ON WHICH DAMAGES ARE SOUGHT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT, STATUTE OR TORT. THEY SHALL NOT APPLY, HOWEVER, IF AND TO THE EXTENT DAMAGES CANNOT NOT BE LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE MANDATORY LAW.\n\n\

Software may contain components provided by Bitext Innovations SL which are governed by a separate license agreement between You and Bitext rather than this SLA.\n\n\n\
\
\
5.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n\
\
5.1  Indemnification. If You obtained the Software from Actuate directly, Actuate shall, at its own expense, defend or, at its option, settle, any claim or action brought against You by a third-party, and to indemnify You and Your officers, directors, and employees against all damages and costs, including reasonable legal fees finally awarded against You attributable to such claim or action, resulting from such claim or action, or the settlement by Actuate thereof, if and to the extent such claim or action is based on actual infringement of such third-party claimant's patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark under United States or Canadian laws by Your use in accordance with this SLA of Software or support services provided by Actuate.

\
5.2  Right to Substitute. Without limiting Section 5.1 hereof, if a final injunction is, or Actuate believes in its sole discretion is likely to be, entered prohibiting the use of Software or support services by You as contemplated herein, Actuate may, at its sole option and expense, either: (a) procure for You the right to use the infringing Software or support services as provided herein, (b) replace the infringing items with non-infringing, functionally equivalent products, (c) suitably modify the infringing items so that they are no longer infringing, or if (a), (b) or (c) above is not obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, (d) accept return of the infringing items and refund (i) for perpetual licenses, the then present value of the license fees paid for such Software, as amortized over a forty-eight (48) month life or (ii) for Subscription Licenses or support services, pre-paid fees on a pro-rated basis for the unused portion of the Subscription or support term. Except as specified above, Actuate will not be liable for any costs or expenses incurred without its prior written authorization.\n\n\

THE FOREGOING INDEMNITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT ANY INFRINGEMEMENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY USE OF THE THEN-CURRENT SOFTWARE RELEASE.\n\n\n\
\
\
6.  TERMINATION.\n\n\
\
6.1  Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this SLA if the other party commits a material breach of this SLA and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written request to cure. Neither party may terminate this SLA except as expressly provided herein or in Section 1.3 (as it relates to No Cost and Evaluation Licenses).  \n\n\
\
6.2  Termination for Support. Once paid, support service fees are non-refundable. If You desire to reinstate support services that have been cancelled, You will pay Actuate the applicable reinstatement fees in addition to the support services fees that would otherwise have been due for the period between the effective date of cancellation of support services and the effective date of reinstatement and the support services fee for the one (1) year period from the effective date of reinstatement based on the non-discounted list price in effect at the time support is reinstated. If You cancel support services for any portion of the Software, Actuate reserves the right to adjust the discount applied to the support services fee for the remaining Software. Termination of support services shall not terminate this SLA.\n\n\
\
6.3  Obligations Upon Termination. Upon termination or expiration of this SLA, You will immediately destroy or return to Actuate all Software, Documentation and Proprietary Information in Your possession and, upon Actuate's request, certify compliance with this obligation in a writing duly signed by an authorized representative.

\
\
7.  GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n\
\
7.1  Choice of Law; Arbitration. This SLA and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this SLA, the Software, or any support services performed by Actuate ("Dispute") will be governed by California law. The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply. If You are based in the United States, You submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in San Mateo County, California, USA, and all Disputes shall be exclusively subject to the jurisdiction of such courts. Otherwise, all Disputes shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration before three (3) arbitrators pursuant to the rules and under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce. The arbitrators shall have the authority to determine issues of arbitrability and to award compensatory damages, but they shall not award punitive or exemplary damages. At either party's request, the arbitrators shall issue a written decision explaining the facts and legal reasoning on which their decision is based. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in London, England and in the English language. The prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled, under either a legal action or arbitration proceeding.\n\n\
\
7.2  Complete Agreement. This SLA and any writings issued by Actuate that are expressly incorporated herein (including, without limitation, Actuate's specification of the applicable license parameters and of the legal entity that is entitled to use the Software and support services, be in through an invoice or otherwise) represent the entire agreement and understanding between the parties and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements and understandings regarding the subject matter hereof including but not limited to the version of the Software provided with this SLA. Actuate does not accept, and Actuate hereby expressly rejects, any additional terms that You may present at any time on purchase orders or otherwise.\n\n\
\
7.3  Relationship. The relationship between the parties created by this SLA is that of independent contractors and not partners, joint venturers, or agents.\n\n\
\
7.4  No Third-Party Beneficiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this SLA.\n\n\
\
7.5  Headings. Section headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this SLA.\n\n\
\
7.6  Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable or deemed in default for any delay or failure in performance of an order or any part of this SLA, other than a failure to pay, to the extent that such delay or failure is caused by the following, but not limited to: accident, fire, industry-wide strike, embargo, act of the government, war, terrorism or national emergency requirement, act of God, act of the public enemy or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of You or Actuate. If any of the foregoing condition occurs, the party delayed or unable to perform shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give notice to the other party and continue performing this SLA to the fullest extent possible.\n\n\
\
7.7  Mutual Non-Exclusivity. Actuate may license Software and/or provide support services to other entities that may be in competition with You. You may work with other entities that may be in competition with Actuate. This is a non-exclusive arrangement.\n\n\
\
7.8  No Modification or Waivers. This SLA cannot be modified or amended except (a) in a writing signed by an authorized Actuate officer or (b) by a subsequent click wrap license agreement distributed with an upgrade to a subsequent version of the Software. For example, if You upgrade Version 10 of the Software to Version 11, the click wrap license agreement distributed with Version 11 of the Software will replace your existing license agreement. No modification can be accomplished by course of conduct.
